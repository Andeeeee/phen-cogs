# Tags [WIP]

Welcome to the incomplete TagScript documentation. This will explain the custom TagScript blocks. If a block you are looking for isn't here, then you should check if its in the base [TagScriptEngine docs](https://github.com/JonSnowbd/TagScript).

### Blocks:
- command
- delete
- args
- author
- target
- channel
- server

**Block Syntax:**

`{block(payload):parameter}`

`[arg]` = Optional

`<arg>` = Required


**Command Block**

Usage: `{command: <command>}`

Aliases: `c, com, command`

Payload: None

Parameter: command

The command block will run the given command as if the tag invoker had ran it. Only 3 can be used in a tag.


**Delete Block**

Usage: `{delete([bool])`

Payload: bool, None

Parameter: None

Delete blocks will delete the invocation message if the given payload is true. If there is no payload i.e. `{delete}` it will default to true.


**Args Block**

Usage: `{args([index])`
